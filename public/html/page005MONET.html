<h1>The Dormitory Gymnasium</h1>

<p><strong>When</strong> : All days 18:00 - 22:00 o clock.</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong> : At building 900 <span style="color: #fbfdfa;">There is a fitnes gym and behind it there is the Gymnasium. I refer to the Gymnasium to play Volleyball, badminton and basketball </span>   </p>

<p><strong>What to bring</strong> : You do not really need something besides sportswear. Because of the covid we had to scan a QR-code and fill out a little google form every time came. Not sure how long this policy will stay tho.</p>


<p><strong>What to do</strong> : Certainly, playing sports is a great idea! To find the schedule, you can visit this link: <a href="https://snudorm.snu.ac.kr/en/living-guide/facility-guide/gym/">https://snudorm.snu.ac.kr/en/living-guide/facility-guide/gym/</a>. Normally, there are training sessions four times a week. Please note that the gym is exclusively for dormitory residents, and you don't need to pay anything or submit any applications. Simply go there, approach the people, and ask if you can join them. It's that simple! In addition, you can find the Dormitory cafeteria in building 901, which offers meals three times a day, including weekends and holidays. Make sure to check it out for a convenient dining option. For the volleyball team you can have a look into their Instagrampage <a href="https://www.instagram.com/snudive/?hl=en"> https://www.instagram.com/snudive/?hl=en </a> too. </p>

<p><strong>Next Magic Word</strong> : You can see a clock on the wall, the clock has five letters written under the 12. Those 5 letters are the password for the next location.</p>

<p><strong>Next location</strong>:  The GSES building number 82</p>
