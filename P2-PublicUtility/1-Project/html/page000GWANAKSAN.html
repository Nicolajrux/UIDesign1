<h1>The Gymnasium</h1>

<p><strong>When</strong> : All days 09:00 - 22:00. However if you want to play on a court you have to reserve it first. </p>
<p><strong>Where</strong> : Builidng 71 and 71-1</p>

<p><strong>What to bring</strong> : Nothing to bring</p>


<p style="padding-bottom: 50px;"><strong>What to do</strong> : The 71 Building is actually the old gym. It's got this massive area with three courts right next to each other. You can play badminton, volleyball, handball, and basketball there, but you have to join a club or <a href="https://athletics.snu.ac.kr/facility/list">book the fields</a>. Upstairs, they've got judo, taekwondo, and table tennis. Oh, and on the first floor, there's a fitness gym too. You can just walk in without booking, but it's pretty small and doesn't have a ton of machines.

Now, in the new gym, called the 71-1 building, there's this big gymnasium where you can play volleyball, handball, badminton, and basketball too. Behind the 71 Gymnasium, there's a swimming pool in the 71-2 building. I haven't tried it yet, though, but heart it is good. Oh, and they've got soccer, tennis, and baseball fields too. If you want more details, just click on the website link.</p>

<p><strong>Next location</strong>: Building 101 the Vegan Cafeteria and the S-Card center </p>


<p><strong>Reserving the Gymnasium</strong> :Compared to booking a room in the library, booking the gymnasium is ridiculously hard, because the slots get snatched up right away. So, here's what you gotta do: Go to the <a href="https://athletics.snu.ac.kr/facility/list">Gym Facilities website</a> and pick the court you wanna book. Look for the dates that are marked in blueâ€”they're the available ones. Once you've chosen your court, log in with your SNU credentials. Then, you'll see the available time slots. Pick the one you want, add your buddy's info, agree to the terms and conditions, and voila! You've booked it if you where fast enough. No shit the volleyball gym usually is booked out in the first 13 seconds.

So here's a tip: New dates are released every Tuesday at 09:30 a.m. If you wanna boost your chances, save your friend's ID locally so you can quickly copy-paste it. Personally, I use this Google plug-in called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-clicker-autofill/iapifmceeokikomajpccajhjpacjmibe">Auto Clicker Auto Fill</a>. As soon as the site loads, it fills out the form for you. You can get the Jason file for the form of the 301 ho gym and the Bcourt in 71 dong from <a href="../downloadable/AutoFillConfigurations.json" download>here (JSON CONFIG)</a> and <a href="../downloadable/ReadMe.txt" download>Readme</a>. Just remember, you gotta change the date in the link each time. But don't worry, you can do that in the URL. Oh, and if you want a specific time, you can change those eight-digit numbers. There's another text file that tells you which number corresponds to which time. It is a little complicated at the beginning but after a few times you will get it - I'm sure!
