<h1>The Vegan cafeteria and the S-Card</h1>

<p><strong>When</strong> : The Vegan cafeteria Weekdays 11:30-13:00 </p>
<p><strong>Where</strong> : The Vegan cafeteria is a building 101 and the S-Card at 67</p>

<p><strong>What to bring</strong> : For the Vegan cafeteria you just need a bank card which works in Korea and for the S-card application you need to bring a picture in passport format.  More information for the S-card can be found on <a href="https://oia.snu.ac.kr/s-card">OIA website</a>.</p>


<p><strong>What to do</strong> : In the Vagan cafeteria, you can totally grab some grub. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure if it's vegan or vegetarian, but they call it the vegan cafeteria. It's a bit pricier, around 7000 Won, but it's a buffet, so you can stuff yourself silly. Right behind the vegan cafeteria, you'll find the student center where you can snag the S-Card. Having the S-Card is crucial because you need it to access buildings like the library or get discounted meals at the cafeteria. Once you're an SNU student, you'll have the mobile S-Card on your phone, so you can enter buildings and whatnot without the physical card, just by using the MySNU app. But personally, I think it's more convenient to have the actual card. You can also get the S-Card along with a bank account. Check out the <a href="https://oia.snu.ac.kr/s-card">OIA website</a> for more deets. </p>
